It is very simple but good looking car race game.It was created in c++ and OpenGL for 3d graphics and Havok physics library for physics simulation.Sound is generated by FMOD library and glut is used for GUI.It also have some of basic  AI cars,not good enough though.Very nice project for learning for beginners.
